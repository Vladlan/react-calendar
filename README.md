To start app locally: `npm start` (you should run `npm i` before first app start)

**Completed:**

• A user must be able to view their calendar  
• A user must be able to add an appointment to their calendar including a date, time, description of the event and a list of attendees (email addresses)  
• A user should not be able to add an appointment for a time that an appointment already exists (they should receive a warning when they try)  
• A user should be able to edit their appointments  
• Optional: A user should be able to email appointments to attendees

**Optional Nice to Haves:**  
• User Login  
• Use Redux

**Not Completed:**  
• Supply Tests (Out of time)

**What can be improved (Author thoughts):**  
• At least utils should be covered with tests  
• Sub reducers should be added  
• Barrel files for components folder should be provided  
• Forms can be implemented with formik  
• Add redirection when entering /calendar from a link on a new browser
